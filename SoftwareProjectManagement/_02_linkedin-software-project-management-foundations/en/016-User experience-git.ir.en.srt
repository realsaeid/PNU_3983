1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.001
- I used to confuse a good user interface, UI for short,

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.000
with a good user experience, or UX for short.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.001
Looking at some of the apps I've been using,

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.002
I think I'm not the only one.

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.000
A good user interface looks great.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.005
It's stylish and attractive.

7
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.009
A good user experience may have a nice-looking interface,

8
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.004
but more importantly, it also functions well.

9
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:29.001
It understands users' common pathways through the system

10
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.004
and makes those features easy to use and access.

11
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.007
That means rule number one when planning your UX

12
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.004
is know the difference and recognize that a good UI

13
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:44.001
is only a part of the whole user experience.

14
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.009
So how do you do that?

15
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.002
Well the most important action to take with your new app

16
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.004
is spending sufficient time with the people

17
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.002
who will be using it.

18
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.003
The main thought behind your design approach

19
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:59.009
must be what's best for the user?

20
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.007
Guide your team toward using design thinking techniques

21
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:08.002
to make sure it gets its UX design right from the beginning.

22
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:12.001
Design thinking is a way to blend the user's needs

23
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.001
with the organization's strategic goals and context.

24
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.000
A team using design thinking

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.006
will consider multiple solutions to the problem

26
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:23.000
before choosing one solution.

27
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.006
Here's a five-step process to practice

28
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:28.006
design thinking on your project.

29
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.008
First is empathize.

30
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:32.009
Meet with users by interviewing them

31
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.009
and perhaps shadowing them as they do their work.

32
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.000
Understand their real-life experiences without judgment.

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.002
Go in with the goal to understand.

34
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.007
Define is the second step.

35
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:49.001
Map out personas and the objectives of their role.

36
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:53.002
This is where you'll define the challenges that users face.

37
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:56.006
Third is ideate where your team brainstorms ways

38
00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:58.006
to solve the pain points you discovered

39
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.003
in the first two steps.

40
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.008
Your team will conduct a lot of research

41
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.008
and explore for solutions.

42
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:07.006
Then prioritize the ones they've discovered

43
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.001
for further investigation.

44
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.006
The fourth step is prototyping.

45
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.009
Develop mock-ups and storyboards

46
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.002
to flush out the ideas more fully.

47
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:21.002
The key is to fail fast by trying several ideas

48
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.007
and assessing feasibility quickly.

49
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.008
Finally, the fifth step is test.

50
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.001
Try the prototypes out to see what really works.

51
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.001
This won't be a one and done step.

52
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.002
Expect to go through more than one iteration

53
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:41.001
before your team finds the right solution.

54
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.002
Designing for the whole UX is essential

55
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:47.005
to making sure the app you build is fit for purpose.

56
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.003
When you guide your team through design thinking,

57
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:55.000
you're helping them succeed with a great user experience.
