00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.008
- Thank you so much for joining me

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.001
on this journey of managing different types

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.001
of software development projects.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.005
Each type of software project has its own

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.002
special circumstances for you to tackle.

6
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.004
I'm sure you recognize that the techniques

7
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.006
we talked about can be used on any project.

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.005
In the exercise files, you'll find a checklist

9
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.005
for each type of software project

10
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:27.002
and the approaches we discovered along the way.

11
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.003
To continue your learning, I recommend

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.001
you check out "Leading the Transformation"

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.002
by Gary Gruver and Tommy Mouser.

14
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.009
This is a wonderful guide on implementing

15
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.007
DevOps in your Legacy environment.

16
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.003
Explore the deep content in the LinkedIn

17
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.008
learning library around DevOps.

18
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.003
This knowledge will make your

19
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.006
software projects more successful.

20
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.008
And search for more on user experience in the library

21
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.008
if you're passionate about ensuring

22
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:57.009
your users have great experiences with your applications.

23
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.003
Thank you again for joining me as we looked

24
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:04.000
at the foundations of software project management.

25
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.006
Please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

26
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.007
