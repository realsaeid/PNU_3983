00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.002
- You may already know how you're going to

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.008
release your application.

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.003
If you're working in an agile environment,

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.005
you may release your product

5
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.004
in small, frequent, modular pieces.

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.002
If you're working in a more traditional environment,

7
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.006
you may release your application all at once.

8
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:20.002
This is often referred to as a big bang release.

9
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.000
Either way, there are actions you need to do

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.002
to ensure your release goes smoothly,

11
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.005
and teams are ready to offer support

12
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.002
for your new application.

13
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.004
Let's explore these essential steps.

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.000
First and foremost, be sure all forms

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.005
of testing have occurred.

16
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.009
Ideally, you'll tackle these throughout

17
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.007
the development life cycle.

18
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.001
At a minimum, you'll need user acceptance testing,

19
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.008
integration testing, regression testing,

20
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.004
performance testing, and end-to-end,

21
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.007
or system testing.

22
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.002
All of these types, combined together,

23
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.001
provide visibility into how well

24
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.003
your application will perform.

25
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:02.003
Further, these will confirm that your users

26
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:05.005
are getting exactly what they're expecting.

27
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.005
Next, address user readiness.

28
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.003
Let your users know when your application is coming,

29
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.009
so they're ready for it.

30
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.002
If there are user guides being developed,

31
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.003
these need to be ready to go as well.

32
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.004
And don't limit your user-readiness

33
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.006
to just your direct users.

34
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.009
Make sure users of systems integrated with your app

35
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.007
know the release is coming too.

36
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.001
Another key item to tackle is operations readiness.

37
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.001
Work with the operations and support teams

38
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.003
to let them know about your release,

39
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:40.006
and how they may need to help you during that final push.

40
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.005
I hope you've put some Dev Ops practices in place.

41
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:47.003
If you have, the Ops teams already know what's been built,

42
00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:51.005
and how it integrates seamlessly into the ecosystem.

43
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.001
The Ops team will also be ready to partner

44
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.008
with your development team

45
00:01:55.008 --> 00:02:00.001
to create a great support experience for your users.

46
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.006
Finally, connect with your team

47
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:05.000
to handle the migration readiness.

48
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.009
Double-check that everyone knows exactly what steps to take

49
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.006
to move your application to the production environment.

50
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.002
Simple check lists for the migration steps

51
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.001
can help the team immensely,

52
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.003
especially if the migration process isn't automated.

53
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.006
Be sure to take the time to prepare for your release.

54
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:29.000
When you do, you'll find the process can be simple.
