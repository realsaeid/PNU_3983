00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.003
- When I was assigned my first new build software project,

2
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:08.006
I thought, no problem how hard can this be, it's brand new.

3
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.002
Boy, was I wrong.

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.004
I quickly learned how hard it can be

5
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.000
and how many things can go wrong.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.006
This type of project has its own unique

7
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.001
set of challenges to get in front of.

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.006
Lets take a look at them.

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:26.008
First, there's user experience, UX for short.

10
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.004
No matter what type of application you're building,

11
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.002
a website, mobile app, or an accounting system,

12
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.004
you're going to need a feature rich front end.

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.006
If you don't build it with UX in mind,

14
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.007
you may produce an application your users won't want to use.

15
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.008
Next, comes the fact that no application stands alone.

16
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.005
Address issues related to

17
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.003
existing legacy systems and infrastructure.

18
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:51.007
Maybe the app you're building

19
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.003
is replacing a legacy system

20
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.004
or perhaps it's just integrating

21
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.005
with these existing apps.

22
00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.003
Either way, you may face barriers

23
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:02.007
to your new application because of these entrenched areas.

24
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:06.005
Another challenge unique to new build appplications

25
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.003
is building it for the future.

26
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.009
I don't mean that your application needs to be futuristic,

27
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.008
but it does need to be built for scalability.

28
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.006
Your application will grow and be modified

29
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:21.009
over time in a way that enhances its usefulness.

30
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.009
Finally, along the lines of scalability,

31
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.006
is developing your application for maintenance and support.

32
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.003
Your team needs to release an application

33
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:34.008
that both users and support teams love.

34
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:36.009
There's a special balance your team

35
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.000
has to use to make sure both sides are being heard

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.006
as the design progresses.

37
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.005
While on the surface it seems that building something

38
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.006
from scratch is easy, it's far more difficult than that.

39
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.007
As you tackle your new build software project,

40
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:54.009
keep these challenges in mind

41
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.005
so you can prepare for them.

42
00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:02.000
When you do, you'll deliver a new app everyone will love.
