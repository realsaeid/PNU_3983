1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.005
- No two projects are the same.

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.003
That's true across all industries.

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:09.009
Projects, regardless of framework or methodology,

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.007
share the same project life cycles.

5
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:17.000
Specifically, all projects face initiating, planning,

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.002
executing, and closing.

7
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.007
Even as these steps are shared,

8
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:25.007
software development projects are unique in themselves.

9
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.009
They have a development life cycle to contend with

10
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.000
that's separate and distinct from the project life cycle.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.007
You need to know how to blend

12
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.007
what you already know as a project manager,

13
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:41.006
so you can adapt your skills to the specialized needs

14
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.006
of software development.

15
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.005
In this course, we'll explore in depth

16
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.000
how software projects are different.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.009
We'll cover everything from project management frameworks,

18
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.008
vendor selection, and stakeholder mapping

19
00:00:55.008 --> 00:01:00.002
to user experience and developing for scalability.

20
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.002
Hi, I'm Kelley O'Connell.

21
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.005
I've been a traditional project manager,

22
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:05.006
a scrum master,

23
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:09.007
and I'm now an agile coach and transformation strategist.

24
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.000
I've been leading teams for more than 20 years.

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I've also been leading organizations

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.007
through agile transitions for 10 years.

27
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.002
Please join me as we explore the world

28
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:25.000
of software development project management.
