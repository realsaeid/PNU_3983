1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.005
- There are thousands of COTS applications on the market.

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.007
How on earth can you be sure you're selecting the right one?

3
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.004
I've been through several of these types of projects,

4
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.006
and one key to making sure you select

5
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.005
the right product and vendor,

6
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:19.005
is the request for proposal, RFP for short.

7
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:23.005
There are key elements that every RFP needs to include.

8
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:24.009
Let's take a look at these

9
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.002
in the context of our sample CRM project.

10
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.006
First, always open your RFP

11
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:34.000
with an introduction or executive summary.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.008
This section is pretty short,

13
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:40.000
and just really sets the stage for potential vendors.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.008
Using our CRM project example,

15
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.006
I would explain the high level goals we hope to attain

16
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.004
from the right CRM solution.

17
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.003
Next, be sure to include the business background.

18
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:57.001
It's really helpful for vendors to understand your company,

19
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.000
markets you serve, company values,

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.004
and what makes your company special.

21
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.007
Third, be sure to include your project goals.

22
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.002
Here, we let them know

23
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:11.006
who the users will be in your company.

24
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:15.000
In our example, we want a CRM solution that's built

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.006
for both our sales people and our customer support team,

26
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:23.003
Next, is where all that requirements work comes in.

27
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:27.001
We need to include our project scope, and deliverables.

28
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.002
In this section, I usually include these details:

29
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.007
how we'll be managing the project,

30
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.006
communication and progress monitoring,

31
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:39.001
any dependencies we know about,

32
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.000
how we plan to accept and validate the vendor's work,

33
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.004
how our changes will be handled,

34
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:49.003
and our expectations about support and maintenance.

35
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:51.004
Finally, I create a table

36
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:54.008
and put the requirements I've gathered here.

37
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:57.005
Fifth, we need to include our timeline.

38
00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:00.008
How soon do we want to implement a solution?

39
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.005
Next, we need to share

40
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.007
the vendor response format we want them to use.

41
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:08.008
We do this to help simplify our analysis

42
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.008
when the responses roll in.

43
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:15.002
Usually, I ask them to send an executive summary,

44
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.007
background information on them,

45
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.006
proposed solution and deliverables,

46
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.002
details of how closely they meet our requirements,

47
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.007
their preferred timeline and budget,

48
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:29.001
and customer references.

49
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.005
Then, I share our budget information with them.

50
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:35.005
Generally, I provide an expected budget range

51
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.000
for both the implementation

52
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.003
and ongoing support and maintenance costs.

53
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:44.007
Next, I offer details of the important selection criteria.

54
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.006
This section isn't restricted

55
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:48.008
to our most important requirements.

56
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.009
It also offers a window

57
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:54.000
into the kind of vendor we want to work with,

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.008
and what type of partnership we prefer.

59
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:01.009
Finally, I share with the vendors, the proposal timeline.

60
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.008
I usually provide potential vendors

61
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.009
a 30 day window to respond.

62
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.005
I also tell them how long it will take us

63
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.009
to make a decision, and how they'll be notified.

64
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.006
Usually, I also include a window for them

65
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:19.001
to demonstrate their product to our decision makers.

66
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.006
I've placed a sample RFP template in the exercise files

67
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:26.002
for you to review or use as you need.

68
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:29.000
While the RFP process can be lengthy,

69
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.009
when you follow these steps,

70
00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:33.006
you'll be sure to select the right COTS solution

71
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:36.000
for your organization.
