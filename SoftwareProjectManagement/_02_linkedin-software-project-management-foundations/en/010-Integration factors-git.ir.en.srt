1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.007
- No matter what vendor or solution you're dealing with,

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:07.000
be sure you take into account the integration angle

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.008
of your COTS project.

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.008
Let's go back to our CRM project

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.000
and explore integrations from this perspective.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.006
We've selected our vendor and our solution.

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.006
Now we're ready to hold a joint planning session

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.004
with our team and the vendor's team.

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.002
We need to deeply explore the idea

10
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.004
of integrating the new application

11
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.001
into our technical ecosystem.

12
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.000
It would be a rare occurrence

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.003
if a COTS application could stand alone.

14
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.009
In all likelihood, we'll need the new system

15
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.005
to receive information from or send information

16
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.008
to other systems we already have.

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.002
Thinking about our CRM project,

18
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.003
we'll talk to our stakeholders and our IT experts

19
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.007
to find out what information or systems

20
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:57.001
exist both upstream and downstream from our CRM.

21
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.009
For example, perhaps we have a website with a contact form.

22
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.009
If we do, do we need our new CRM solution

23
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.000
to receive information from the website?

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.001
What flags, notifications, or workflow

25
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.000
should this form trigger in our application?

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.009
This is an example of an upstream integration.

27
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.003
Next, let's think about how our CRM solution

28
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.002
should share information it captures.

29
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.000
For example, perhaps we call a customer

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.002
while we're in the CRM.

31
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.003
Do we want integration with a purchasing application

32
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:36.002
so we can place a customer's order from the CRM?

33
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.005
This is an example of a downstream integration.

34
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.006
That means that data captured in our CRM solution

35
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.006
flows out to other applications.

36
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.006
In most COTS projects,

37
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.003
the company will decide who should do the work,

38
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.001
our team or the vendor's.

39
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:53.009
Many COTS products now come

40
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.009
with application program interfaces or APIs

41
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.007
that teams can use to create these integrations.

42
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:04.008
In my experience many COTS agreements

43
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:08.002
request the vendor to do the integration work.

44
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.006
This is because the vendor has usually done

45
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:13.006
these types of integrations with their products before.

46
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.000
It reduces the risk to our company

47
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.009
if we have them perform this work.

48
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.001
All COTS products require some level

49
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.005
of integration with existing systems.

50
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.004
Make sure you're asking your users and IT pros

51
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:29.008
for help in identifying the key integrations needed.

52
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.009
When you do, you'll make sure your COTS application

53
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.000
works exactly as planned.
