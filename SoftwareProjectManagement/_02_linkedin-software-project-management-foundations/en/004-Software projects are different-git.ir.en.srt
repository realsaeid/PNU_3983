00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.009
- A project is a project is a project, right?

2
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.002
Well, actually, no.

3
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.003
Software development projects are different.

4
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:13.002
They tend to be more complex

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.005
with additional moving parts when compared

6
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.001
to your garden variety project.

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.003
We already know that software development has its own

8
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.008
software development lifecycle we need to look out for.

9
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.006
That by itself adds complexity,

10
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.001
but that's not our only constraint,

11
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.006
so let's take a look at what contributes

12
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.004
to the additional complexity

13
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.000
of software development projects.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.007
First, there are many different

15
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.008
software design patterns a team can use.

16
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.005
These patterns are repeatable ways

17
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.006
to solve common software design problems.

18
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.008
Here, you'll need to partner with your development team

19
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.007
to understand which pattern they plan to utilize.

20
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.004
Knowing this, the team will guide you

21
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:01.008
to understand the pattern steps they'll follow.

22
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:03.007
This will help you know the way

23
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.008
in which work will flow through the team.

24
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:10.005
On a higher level, there are software architecture patterns

25
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:14.002
that define the overall layout of the application.

26
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.005
The most common pattern is the layered pattern.

27
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.001
This is simply a way in which the code

28
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.006
is split up into different layers.

29
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:26.003
Each layer has its own set of responsibilities.

30
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.004
The advantage of this comes in terms

31
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.003
of troubleshooting and maintenance.

32
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.006
It's easier to identify which layer may be the culprit

33
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.003
of trouble in your application.

34
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.001
First, let's get the lingo established.

35
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:40.009
The layered pattern is also

36
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.000
called a multi-layered architecture.

37
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.006
Most commonly, it's referred to as multi-tier architecture.

38
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:52.002
Sometimes you'll see it referenced as N-tier

39
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.002
to indicate there's no requirement on the number

40
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.005
of layers your software can have.

41
00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:01.003
So, let's talk about the most common multi-tier structure

42
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:02.008
that you'll run into.

43
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:05.008
In this architecture, you'll usually find

44
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.005
the presentation layer.

45
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.002
This is the space where your users will interact

46
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.006
with your system.

47
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.001
You'll need to be sure that user experience

48
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.003
is considered in the design.

49
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.002
Second is the application layer.

50
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:23.000
Logic and business rules are applied in this layer.

51
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.005
For example, if your presentation layer has a shopping cart

52
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:29.005
in it, this is where the contents are tallied

53
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:31.004
and taxes applied.

54
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:34.001
Lastly, we have the data layer.

55
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.001
This is where the data persists

56
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:40.003
through the database servers, file shares, et cetera.

57
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:43.001
Be aware that this tier is also the one

58
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.003
that exposes the data.

59
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:48.005
Say your customer has three items in their shopping cart.

60
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:52.008
When they add an item, it's saved to the data tier.

61
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.004
This is why online vendors can show you

62
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.006
what's in your shopping cart.

63
00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:00.008
As your team goes through the software design process,

64
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:04.000
they'll need to consider all the architectural layers.

65
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.001
This contributes to the complexity

66
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.000
of software development project management.

67
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.009
When you consider these complexities

68
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.005
for your software project, you'll be ready

69
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:17.000
to create the application your business needs.
