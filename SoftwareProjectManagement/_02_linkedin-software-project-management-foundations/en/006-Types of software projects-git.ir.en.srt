1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.009
- We've established that software development projects

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.004
are unique.

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:09.006
Do you think all software development projects are the same?

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.006
I can tell you for sure they're not.

5
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.001
In fact, there are many types of software projects

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.004
you might manage in your career.

7
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.003
I've categorized these into three broad groups

8
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.000
of software projects. Each category will demand

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.009
a slightly different skill set from you.

10
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.004
The first is known as a Commercial Off-The-Shelf

11
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.007
or COTS project.

12
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.004
You'll work on this type of project whenever a company

13
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.004
chooses to buy a solution to a business problem

14
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.005
instead of building a solution to the problem.

15
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.006
In many cases it's less expensive and delivers

16
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.004
faster results if a product is purchased

17
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.000
instead of developed.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.007
This project type occurs across industries so it's

19
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.009
very likely you'll have a chance to run

20
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.007
this software project during your career.

21
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:01.005
One of the challenges in the COTS category

22
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:05.003
is your dependency on a vendor to partner with you

23
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.002
during an implementation.

24
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:11.000
You can use a Request For Proposal, or RFP,

25
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to help you make your choice.

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.003
The next type of software project

27
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:19.003
is the software enhancement project.

28
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.004
This often occurs when a company has

29
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:25.002
built a solution themselves at some point in the past.

30
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.008
The benefit of enhancing an existing application

31
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:32.002
is that you have people already using it.

32
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:36.006
That makes it easier to understand what changes are needed.

33
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:40.008
This type can be particularly challenging if the original

34
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:44.007
development team didn't leave robust documentation.

35
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.007
In those cases you'll need the team to do some

36
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:52.001
reverse engineering to understand how the software was built

37
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.002
and what design decisions they made.

38
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.008
Finally, there's the New Build Software project;

39
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:01.008
sometimes this is called Scratch Development.

40
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.008
The benefit to this type of project is the opportunity

41
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:08.001
to create exactly what your business needs.

42
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:12.001
In this category you'll face many challenges,

43
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.004
not the least of which is the fact that you and the team

44
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:20.006
may only have an objective or idea in mind when you start.

45
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.005
Use your leadership skills to navigate the team

46
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.000
through the unknown.

47
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
A blank sheet of paper is always intimidating, so this will

48
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.005
take strong communication and guidance from you.

49
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:36.000
One of the keys to this type of software project is to

50
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.001
fully understand the problem,

51
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.002
have strong contacts within the user community,

52
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:45.004
and keep those lines of communication open.

53
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:48.007
In the rest of this course we'll explore each of these

54
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.008
software project types in detail, in its own chapter.

55
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.005
We'll look into how each one is unique, and follow

56
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:59.004
a real life example of a project, so you develop

57
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:03.001
a great understanding of the knowledge you'll need.

58
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.001
As you learn all this information you'll grow

59
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:10.005
in your confidence and ability to manage any kind of

60
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:13.000
software project that comes your way.
