00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.001
- When you're enhancing an existing application,

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.003
you have to be very careful to ensure

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.009
that all your customers or stakeholders

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.009
are identified and engaged in your efforts.

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.002
By doing this, you'll make sure your enhancements

6
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.007
don't alienate your users.

7
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.001
One of the biggest mistakes that can be made

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:24.005
is by only identifying direct users of your system.

9
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.009
Sounds strange, but let's explore this idea.

10
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.007
If we're enhancing an existing application,

11
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:34.004
say, a website, of course the people who use the site

12
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:38.000
need to be considered, but are they the only ones?

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
No, of course not.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.008
Think about all the other people

15
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.002
who indirectly use the website.

16
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:48.004
For example, imagine we need to upgrade a bank's website.

17
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:52.001
Now think about all the people besides your customers

18
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.001
who rely on the website in some way.

19
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.003
Perhaps there's a marketing department

20
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.000
that uses the site to post about new products,

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.005
or it pulls statistics from the site

22
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.009
to see what customers use most frequently.

23
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.004
What about a customer accounting department

24
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:12.005
that relies on site transactions to keep balances updated?

25
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.007
You get the idea.

26
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:15.007
There are many stakeholders to consider

27
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.004
when making enhancements.

28
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.001
So what do you do about it?

29
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.001
I always use the process of stakeholder mapping

30
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.007
to guide me as I engage my stakeholders, learn from them,

31
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.001
and keep them up to date on progress.

32
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.005
It sounds mysterious, but stakeholder mapping

33
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.005
is actually pretty easy to do.

34
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.004
Here's how.

35
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.007
Start by identifying your stakeholders

36
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.009
by making a list of everyone you can think of.

37
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.002
No filters, just brainstorm to generate a list.

38
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.007
Once you have a list,

39
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.004
you need to prioritize your stakeholders.

40
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.004
No, that doesn't mean that some

41
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.002
are more important than others.

42
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.006
It simply means that you're analyzing to determine

43
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:02.000
which ones have the most influence over your project

44
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.001
and have the most interest.

45
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.008
Now you'll map them onto a grid like this one.

46
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:09.009
In my experience,

47
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.009
I use categories of users for this exercise.

48
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.001
So I'd map the marketing department as a whole

49
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:20.000
even though I have a single point of contact for the group.

50
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.002
Next, you'll meet with your stakeholders

51
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:25.000
to understand what they want, need,

52
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.005
don't want, and fear from your project.

53
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:31.008
This valuable insight keeps everyone aligned

54
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.001
throughout the project.

55
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:38.000
Finally, you'll decide how to engage with each quadrant.

56
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.006
Those in the upper-right quadrant

57
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:42.007
will need the most communication and engagement.

58
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.005
Those in the upper-left quadrant

59
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:48.002
will need high engagement but not so intensely.

60
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.007
As you move to the bottom half of the grid,

61
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.004
keep stakeholders informed of what you're doing

62
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:55.007
and how things are going.

63
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.006
As you start your software enhancement project,

64
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:00.008
be sure to map your stakeholders

65
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:04.000
so you don't leave anyone behind.
