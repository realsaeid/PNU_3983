00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.005
- In enhancement projects, you'll have many diverse

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.001
stakeholders to please.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.003
While this is true for all projects,

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:12.002
it can be particularly tricky for enhancement projects.

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.008
How do you make sure that all voices are heard?

6
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.009
Holding a joint application design, or JAD session,

7
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.005
is a great tool you can use to solve that problem.

8
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.008
Let's look at how a JAD session works

9
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.004
and how it can help you.

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.001
First, a JAD is a collaborative way

11
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.003
to gather requirements across people and groups.

12
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.007
It focuses on eliciting the needs of everyone

13
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:41.002
and instilling a sense of ownership among your users.

14
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:42.009
Rather than spending time meeting

15
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.005
with each stakeholder group,

16
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.005
you're bringing them all together.

17
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.001
They can hear each other's needs

18
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.007
and negotiate when they have conflicting requirements.

19
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.000
So, who attends?

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, you'll need a representative

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.003
from each stakeholder group you mapped.

22
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.007
For example, if we're enhancing a banking website,

23
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.004
I'd want a representative from marketing,

24
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:08.008
customer accounting, customer relationship, online banking,

25
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.006
and online support.

26
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.006
I don't want all the teams there,

27
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.008
just a designated representative from each area.

28
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:19.005
Keep the JAD session user count to less than 10 people

29
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.002
to ensure great dialogue.

30
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.007
Each representative needs to be familiar

31
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.003
with the day-to-day operations in their area.

32
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:31.002
This will give us the best perspective of their needs.

33
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.006
I usually include my project team, too,

34
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.007
but exclude them from the headcount.

35
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:36.009
Why?

36
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.008
Well, the team is there to ask clarifying questions,

37
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:43.004
not to direct the conversation or contribute.

38
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:46.006
Next, you'll need the project requestor or sponsor

39
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.004
to open and close the JAD sessions.

40
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.006
This person will provide framing for the attendees.

41
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.001
They'll lay out why the project is requested

42
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.004
and the objectives the sponsor is hoping for.

43
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.003
Finally, you'll need a strong facilitator

44
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.003
to host the session.

45
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.003
The facilitator role is critical to the success

46
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.005
of your JAD since they handle the scheduling,

47
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:13.006
dispute mediation, and guide the JAD process.

48
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:17.003
They also need to have zero vested interest in the outcome

49
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:18.005
of the JAD.

50
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.000
This builds trust with the attendees,

51
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
knowing the facilitator is a neutral third party.

52
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.004
In my experience, JAD sessions are full-day meetings

53
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:32.004
and they run anywhere from two to four days in length

54
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.008
depending on the scope of work.

55
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:38.002
When you're starting a project with a lot of stakeholders,

56
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.009
making sure their needs are met is essential

57
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.000
to your success.
