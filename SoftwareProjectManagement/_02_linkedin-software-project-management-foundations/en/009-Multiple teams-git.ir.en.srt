00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.002
- When implementing a COTS solution,

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.007
one of the key challenges you're dealing with

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.001
is having more than one team.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:12.002
Let's explore this using our CRM solution.

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's say we've successfully selected a vendor

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.007
and completed all the legal documentation.

7
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:21.001
We're ready to kick off the implementation itself.

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.004
Now we're going to host a planning meeting

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:27.003
with both our internal team and the vendor's team.

10
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:28.003
At the beginning,

11
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.003
we start with a road map.

12
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:34.006
Vendors usually have a basic implementation road map

13
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.009
they follow with all of their clients.

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.000
This is a great place to start.

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.003
We'll get the vendor team in a planning session

16
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.003
with our team so we both understand

17
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:49.003
what all the deliverables are on the vendor road map.

18
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.004
As we decompose the road map into smaller pieces,

19
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:56.001
we begin to see the dependencies within it.

20
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.009
Let's assume that we've selected

21
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.000
to follow an Agile framework.

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.005
Each of the deliverables on the road map

23
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.009
can be decomposed into stories

24
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.006
and assigned to one of the teams.

25
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:10.002
There will be items only the vendor team can tackle

26
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.007
and items only our internal team can handle.

27
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:15.009
As we go through this planning session,

28
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.000
we'll see how the team need to pass work back

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.008
and forth to each other.

30
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.001
Coming out of this initial planning,

31
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.000
we also need to establish our future processes

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to stay in sync.

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.006
First, establish a scrum of scrums

34
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.008
where the teams can come together at least once a week

35
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:37.007
to share their progress, challenges, and ask for help.

36
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:41.000
Next, set up a way to share work.

37
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.006
Usually we'll need a task or Kanban board

38
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:47.005
that both teams can access, see, and update.

39
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:51.001
Then we'll define how we'll continue to plan jointly

40
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.008
for the duration of the project.

41
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:57.001
Oh, and it's a great idea to complete sprint planning

42
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.001
at the same time every two weeks.

43
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.007
A successful method for this that I've used in the past

44
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:07.003
is to hold joint planning every other Wednesday.

45
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.005
That means we get on a teleconference where we can see

46
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:14.009
and speak to each other and see our shared task board.

47
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.009
This joint planning takes care

48
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.004
of the tactical aspect of implementation.

49
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:24.008
It's also a great idea to have a slightly longer session

50
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.006
every four to six weeks

51
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:28.004
or two to three sprints

52
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.009
to take a step back and compare the team's progress

53
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.005
against the road map we started with.

54
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.001
When we do this,

55
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.001
we're making sure that we're on track both

56
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.006
at the ground level and at the strategic level.

57
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.006
A COTS application will require you

58
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.007
to balance your normal internal practices

59
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:49.008
with the vendor team's needs.

60
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:52.002
With just a little bit of planning,

61
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:57.000
you can do this and keep your COTS implementation on track.
