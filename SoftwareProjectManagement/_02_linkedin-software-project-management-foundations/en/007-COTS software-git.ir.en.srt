00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
- Many companies and government organizations

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.004
prefer to solve their business problems

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:09.002
using commercially available software.

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.004
The logic is pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:16.000
It's much more economical to buy software than to build it.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.002
There are six steps to implementing

7
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:22.000
a commercial off-the-shelf or COTS application.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.003
Let's use an example to explore further.

9
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.007
Say we're on a project

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:29.001
to find the perfect customer relationship management

11
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.005
or CRM system for our company.

12
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.005
What steps would we take?

13
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.006
Well the first step is understanding the requirements

14
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.005
of the software you're shopping for.

15
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.006
In this step we'd start by working with our users.

16
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.008
We'll need to understand

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.001
what functions they need to perform.

18
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.005
For example, the sales team may need to maintain

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.008
customer contact information

20
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.007
and a workflow that matches the sales cycle.

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.006
Requirements for customer support

22
00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.009
and the IT teams will be different.

23
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.003
So identify all the potential users

24
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:05.002
and capture everyone's needs.

25
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.004
The second step is to evaluate and select a product.

26
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.008
In our case we'll start researching

27
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.008
potential vendors in the CRM space.

28
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.003
Usually in a COTS project the users think they know

29
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:19.008
which vendor they want.

30
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.002
At the same time it's a great idea

31
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.008
to host a competitive bid process

32
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:28.002
where we select several vendors, share our requirements,

33
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:32.004
and ask them to submit a proposal for our review.

34
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.008
The third step is to finalize terms

35
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:36.003
with your selected vendor.

36
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:37.008
This will include interaction

37
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.002
with your legal and procurement teams.

38
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.009
Let them know in advance that a purchase is coming

39
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.006
and provide them insight

40
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.008
into when their assistance will be needed.

41
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:51.008
The fourth step is to implement the solution we've selected.

42
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:54.008
In my experience the vendor that's selected

43
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:56.006
will do most of the work.

44
00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.005
However, it's essential that you and your team

45
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.007
are partnered closely with them.

46
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.004
For COTS applications

47
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.002
there are significant configurations to be made

48
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:09.005
so the solution works the way your users need it to.

49
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.007
And don't forget to account for data migration

50
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.007
if you're moving from one system to another.

51
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:19.000
Keep in mind any integrations that need to happen.

52
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.003
For our CRM system perhaps we want to include an integration

53
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.001
with the inventory system

54
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.001
so when our customer buys something

55
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.007
the inventory counts are updated.

56
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:32.000
Finally, in a COTS implementation

57
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.007
you'll need a lot of of system validation.

58
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:37.001
Be sure your project team, user base,

59
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.009
and technical experts are ready to validate

60
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.009
that everything is working as needed.

61
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:46.006
The fifth step is maintenance and upgrade of the solution.

62
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:49.007
While this probably won't happen during your project,

63
00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:52.001
as the project itself closes down,

64
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.001
make sure the IT infrastructure and support teams

65
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:59.001
are ready to take this on when your project wraps up.

66
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:01.008
Include these teams well before going live

67
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:04.009
to ensure support is available.

68
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.006
The sixth and last step

69
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:10.000
is to maintain licenses and subscription fees.

70
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.002
Again this will be outside the control of the project,

71
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:14.008
but it's your responsibility

72
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:17.005
to make sure the area paying for the software

73
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:20.009
has this accounted for in their annual budgets.

74
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.002
While there aren't many steps to a COTS implementation

75
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:26.005
there are several items to consider.

76
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:32.000
When you do your COTS implementation will be a huge success.
